This project is about a website for a restaurant reservation. 
This website offers the users to see the vast menu from the restaurant and check their items.
The users can then choose a date and time to make the reservation for the restaurant.\
where the restaurant owner can deny or accept the request.
After the user has enjoyed their time at the restaurant, they can leave a review
which the restaurant owner can reply and see how much they rated.
The user should not feel worried for their data to be breached as suffiecient security has been implemented
to safely secure their password and the website.
